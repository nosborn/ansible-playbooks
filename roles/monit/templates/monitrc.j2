##
## Check general system resources such as load average, cpu and memory
## usage. Each test specifies a resource, conditions and the action to be
## performed should a test fail.
#
#  check system $HOST
#    if loadavg (1min) > 4 then alert
#    if loadavg (5min) > 2 then alert
#    if cpu usage > 95% for 10 cycles then alert
#    if memory usage > 75% then alert
#    if swap usage > 25% then alert
#
#
## Check if a file exists, checksum, permissions, uid and gid. In addition
## to alert recipients in the global section, customized alert can be sent to
## additional recipients by specifying a local alert handler. The service may
## be grouped using the GROUP option. More than one group can be specified by
## repeating the 'group name' statement.
#
#  check file apache_bin with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
#    if failed checksum and
#       expect the sum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659 then unmonitor

## Check that a process is running, in this case Apache, and that it respond
## to HTTP and HTTPS requests. Check its resource usage such as cpu and memory,
## and number of children. If the process is not running, Monit will restart
## it by default. In case the service is restarted very often and the
## problem remains, it is possible to disable monitoring using the TIMEOUT
## statement. This service depends on another service (apache_bin) which
## is defined above.
